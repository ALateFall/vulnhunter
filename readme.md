# VulnHunter - An Assistant Plugin for IDA Pro Vulnerability Hunting üõ†

**[‰∏≠Êñá](https://github.com/ALateFall/vulnhunter/blob/master/readme_ch.md)** | **English**

`VulnHunter` is an IDA Pro plugin designed for reverse engineers and vulnerability researchers to significantly improve the efficiency and depth of binary vulnerability analysis. It automates tedious manual analysis workflows through a series of powerful enhancements and introduces the analytical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) via the Machine Code Protocol (MCP), opening up new possibilities for vulnerability hunting.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status:** This project is under active development. We welcome you to contribute by submitting [Issues]((https://github.com/ALateFall/vulnhunter/issues)) or Pull Requests!

### üåü What does VulnHunter do? ü§†

- **Call Chain Visualization:** Say goodbye to manually tracing function calls. Highlight the complete call path from a starting point to a destination with a single click.
- **Advanced Cross-References:** Go beyond IDA Pro's native capabilities with complex and customizable cross-reference queries.
- **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Integrates a custom Machine Code Protocol (MCP) to bring powerful AI models into your reverse engineering workflow, enabling automated taint analysis and dangerous function identification.
- **Efficient Shortcuts:** Thoughtfully designed hotkeys allow you to switch between different call chains and analysis paths smoothly.

### ‚ú® Main Features

#### 1. Highlight Call Chain üòÄ

Manually tracing a function's call sources or its ultimate impact in a complex binary is extremely time-consuming and error-prone. VulnHunter completely changes this.

- **Start/End Point Selection:** Simply select a start function and a target function in the disassembly or decompilation view.
- **One-Click Highlighting:** The plugin automatically calculates and highlights all possible call chains connecting the two functions, printing the results to the Output window.
- **Path Switching:** When multiple call paths exist, you can use the hotkey (`Shift+I`) to quickly switch between and preview different call chains.

#### 2. Advanced Cross-References üòÑ (Not Implemented yet)

IDA Pro's native cross-references (Xrefs) are powerful but relatively basic. VulnHunter builds an advanced query engine on top of them, allowing you to filter cross-references in a more granular and semantic way.

- **For Functions üíª:**
  - **Constant Argument Filtering:** Quickly find all locations where a function is called with a specific constant argument (e.g., `0`, `NULL`, or a specific flag).
  - **Contextual Function Filtering:** Filter for functions that call a target function, and also check if these caller functions invoke other specific functions.
- **For Global Variables üîç:**
  - **Assignment/Usage Separation:** Clearly distinguish between all locations where a global variable is written to (assigned) and where it is read from (used).

#### 3. Custom MCP & LLM Integration ü§ñ

By leveraging a custom Machine Code Protocol (MCP) based on fastMCP, we seamlessly integrate IDA Pro's deep binary analysis capabilities with the reasoning power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

- **Functionality Exposure:** The plugin exposes its core "Find Call Chain" and "Advanced Cross-References" features as an API to the LLM.
- **Automated Taint Analysis:** Combined with the **Highlight Call Chain** feature, you can let an LLM act as your taint analysis engine. Simply provide the LLM with a taint source and sink, and it will automatically call VulnHunter's API to find and analyze potential taint propagation paths, achieving end-to-end vulnerability discovery.
- **Intelligent Dangerous Function Identification:** Combined with the **Advanced Cross-References** feature, an LLM can automatically execute complex queries. For example, you can write a prompt that instructs the LLM to find all calls to `memcpy` where the length argument originates from user input and analyze if a buffer overflow risk exists.

Currently, VulnHunter's IDA Pro MCP has implemented the following IDA Pro interfaces:

- `get_function_name_by_addr`: Get the function name from a given address.
- `get_function_addr_by_name`: Get the function address from a given name.
- `Youtube`: Get metadata about the IDA project, such as architecture, version, decompiler status, etc.
- `decompile_function`: Get the pseudo-code for a function at a specified address. This requires an active IDA Pro decompiler.
- `disassemble_function`: Get the assembly code for a function at a specified address.
- `find_call_chain`: Find the function call chain from a start function name to a destination function name. This is a core feature of VulnHunter.

### üîß Installation and Configuration

#### Prerequisites

- **IDA Pro 9.0** or newer.
- **Python 3.11** or newer (the version bundled with IDA Pro is recommended).
- (Optional, for LLM features) A platform that can invoke MCP, such as `cline`.
- (Optional, for LLM features) A valid LLM API Key (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or a locally deployed model API).

#### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Plugin:**

   - Download the two `.py` files from this project: `vulnhunter.py` and `vulnhunter_mcp.py`.

2. **Install the Plugin:**

   - Copy both `vulnhunter.py` and `vulnhunter_mcp.py` into your IDA Pro `plugins` directory.
     - **Windows:** `IDA Pro\plugins`
     - **Linux/macOS:** `~/.idapro/plugins`

3. **(Optional, for MCP usage) Install the MCP functionality:**

   - Install the package via pip:

     Bash

     ```
     pip install git+https://github.com/ALateFall/vulnhunter.git
     ```

   - Then, add the following configuration to your `cline` MCP settings:

     JSON

     ```
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "vulnhunter": {
           "disabled": false,
           "timeout": 60,
           "type": "stdio",
           "command": "vulnhunter"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

### üöÄ Usage Guide

1. Start IDA Pro and load your target binary.
2. (Optional, for MCP usage) Open your MCP platform (e.g., `cline`). VulnHunter will automatically connect to your platform. (You may need to refresh the MCP connection).
3. Use the features as needed:
   - **Highlight Call Chain:** In the disassembly view, right-click the starting address of the source function and select `VulnHunter/Set As Start Addr`. Then, right-click on the destination function and select `VulnHunter/Set As Dest Addr`. Once both addresses are set, right-click anywhere and select `VulnHunter/VulnHunter Hunts`. All call chains will be printed in the Output window. Use `Shift+I` to cycle through highlighting the different chains.
   - **Advanced Cross-References:** Open the "Advanced Cross-References" tab in the main interface, select the target function or global variable, set your filter conditions, and click "Query".
